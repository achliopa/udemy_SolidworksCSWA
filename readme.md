## Section 1 - Starters and Course Overview

### Lecture 3 - What is SOLIDWORKS?

* SolidWorks (stylized as SOLIDWORKS), is a solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software program that runs on Microsoft Windows. The SolidWorks is produced by the Dassault SystÃ¨mes.
* SOLIDWOKRS is reportedly used by more than 3.5 million users around the world.
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogKYHcprYlU) explains what is SOLIDWOKRS.

### Lecture 4 - Exploring the Benefits for SOLIDWORKS Certifications as a User!

* Take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoNakua8rM) which discusses the benefits of having SOLIDWORKS Certificates. The video is centred around the companies [ULC Robotics](https://ulcrobotics.com/) and [MakerBot](https://www.makerbot.com/). However, the same could apply for lots of other companies.

## Section 2 - Basic SOLIDWORKS Interface and Navigation

### Lecture 7 - Starting a New Part

* New file => Part => Ok

### Lecture 8 - Know about the Command Bar, Canvas and Design Tree

* we open the model from courseRepo 'Interface and Navigation model_2013.SLDPRT'
* on top we have command bar: it has all the commands we need to create our model
* in the middle we have the canvas with the model we are working on. on top it has commands related with viewing the model like display style
* on bottom left of canvas we see the 3 axes (x,y,z)
* on the left we have the design tree (all the features and sketches that compose the model)

### Lecture 9 - Adjusting the Document's Measurement Units

* all our solidworks models are based on actual units.
* we set the prefered units in bottom right of bottom menu bar. 
* if we dont like the options we can choose 'Edit Document units' making our custom units

### Lecture 10 - Utilizing the Mouse for More Efficient Models Control and Creation

* RCLICK on canvas, design tree or command menu: more options 
* LCLICK on canvas => mouse scroll = zoom in/out (use cursor as center of movement)
* CLICK+HOLD mouse scroll button => move mouse = 3d rotation

## Section 3 - Let's Start Sketching

### Lecture 13 - Select a Plane to Sketch on

* Sketching is the first step towards creating a 3D model
* We must select a plane to sketch on from design tree. 
* solidwork provides we have 3 basic planes (top, front, right)
* we select top plane => sketch tab => sketch command (OR when clicking plane select sketch option)
* to exit sketch mode select the command of icon on canvas
* in sketch mode we have several sketch related command sin command menu

### Lecture 14 - WATCH OUT!! Always Link your Sketches to the Origin

* when in sketch mode we see the origin (coordinates 0,0) as 2 intercecting red arrows
* we must always have our sketch linked to the origin (fully defined)
* for circle is good practice to make the center of the circle the origin
* always start sketching from the origin

### Lecture 15 - Sketching Basic Shapes Part 1 - Rectangles and Lines

* when in sketch mode the command menu has all available shape
* we select right plane and sketch
* we click line move to irigin and start adding cascading lines. sanp lines are avaialable and indication on vertical and horizontal. to stop drawwing lines DOUBLECLICK or ESC
* we close our polyline to origin (only two lines are fully defined)
* we use the rectangle option to scetch a rectange (there are various types avaialble)
	* corner rectangle. select one corner and move opposite corner
	* center rectangele. select centrer point and expand moving top right corner (rest is symmetrical)
* any complex shape can be broken into simpler shapes

### Lecture 16 -  Sketching Basic Shapes Part 2 - Circles, Arcs and Ellipses

* select top plane and sketch
* we draw a standard circle (center on origin and expand on radius) ESC to stop
* we sketch an arc (centerpoint arc). we seletc the center (of imaginary circle.) then the radius of the imaginary circle and then start drawing the arc along the perimeter
* to delete a sketch (exit sketch => delete)
* to sketch an elplse we click it in command menu => select center then define the main radius and then the secondary. 
* where we do the second click is th max radius point

### Lecture 17 - Using Dimensions (Distances) to Define Your Sketch

*
