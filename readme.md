## Section 1 - Starters and Course Overview

### Lecture 3 - What is SOLIDWORKS?

* SolidWorks (stylized as SOLIDWORKS), is a solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software program that runs on Microsoft Windows. The SolidWorks is produced by the Dassault SystÃ¨mes.
* SOLIDWOKRS is reportedly used by more than 3.5 million users around the world.
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogKYHcprYlU) explains what is SOLIDWOKRS.

### Lecture 4 - Exploring the Benefits for SOLIDWORKS Certifications as a User!

* Take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoNakua8rM) which discusses the benefits of having SOLIDWORKS Certificates. The video is centred around the companies [ULC Robotics](https://ulcrobotics.com/) and [MakerBot](https://www.makerbot.com/). However, the same could apply for lots of other companies.

## Section 2 - Basic SOLIDWORKS Interface and Navigation

### Lecture 7 - Starting a New Part

* New file => Part => Ok

### Lecture 8 - Know about the Command Bar, Canvas and Design Tree

* we open the model from courseRepo 'Interface and Navigation model_2013.SLDPRT'
* on top we have command bar: it has all the commands we need to create our model
* in the middle we have the canvas with the model we are working on. on top it has commands related with viewing the model like display style
* on bottom left of canvas we see the 3 axes (x,y,z)
* on the left we have the design tree (all the features and sketches that compose the model)

### Lecture 9 - Adjusting the Document's Measurement Units

* all our solidworks models are based on actual units.
* we set the prefered units in bottom right of bottom menu bar. 
* if we dont like the options we can choose 'Edit Document units' making our custom units

### Lecture 10 - Utilizing the Mouse for More Efficient Models Control and Creation

* RCLICK on canvas, design tree or command menu: more options 
* LCLICK on canvas => mouse scroll = zoom in/out (use cursor as center of movement)
* CLICK+HOLD mouse scroll button => move mouse = 3d rotation

## Section 3 - Let's Start Sketching

### Lecture 13 - Select a Plane to Sketch on

* Sketching is the first step towards creating a 3D model
* We must select a plane to sketch on from design tree. 
* solidwork provides we have 3 basic planes (top, front, right)
* we select top plane => sketch tab => sketch command (OR when clicking plane select sketch option)
* to exit sketch mode select the command of icon on canvas
* in sketch mode we have several sketch related command sin command menu

### Lecture 14 - WATCH OUT!! Always Link your Sketches to the Origin

* when in sketch mode we see the origin (coordinates 0,0) as 2 intercecting red arrows
* we must always have our sketch linked to the origin (fully defined)
* for circle is good practice to make the center of the circle the origin
* always start sketching from the origin

### Lecture 15 - Sketching Basic Shapes Part 1 - Rectangles and Lines

* when in sketch mode the command menu has all available shape
* we select right plane and sketch
* we click line move to irigin and start adding cascading lines. sanp lines are avaialable and indication on vertical and horizontal. to stop drawwing lines DOUBLECLICK or ESC
* we close our polyline to origin (only two lines are fully defined)
* we use the rectangle option to scetch a rectange (there are various types avaialble)
	* corner rectangle. select one corner and move opposite corner
	* center rectangele. select centrer point and expand moving top right corner (rest is symmetrical)
* any complex shape can be broken into simpler shapes

### Lecture 16 -  Sketching Basic Shapes Part 2 - Circles, Arcs and Ellipses

* select top plane and sketch
* we draw a standard circle (center on origin and expand on radius) ESC to stop
* we sketch an arc (centerpoint arc). we seletc the center (of imaginary circle.) then the radius of the imaginary circle and then start drawing the arc along the perimeter
* to delete a sketch (exit sketch => delete)
* to sketch an elplse we click it in command menu => select center then define the main radius and then the secondary. 
* where we do the second click is th max radius point

### Lecture 17 - Using Dimensions (Distances) to Define Your Sketch

* we will implement a rectangle of 6in wide and 4in height
	* set doc to inches
	* we draw the rectangle (start from origin) on top plane (dimensions dont matter)
	* click smart dimension
	* click on line => drag dimension => release mouse => enter desired dimension (and optional units)
* a rectangle that is dimensioned and anchored (or with set dimensions) from origin is black lined (fully defined)
* to be able to move or resize need to remove the dimension or the anchor to origin respectively
* we draw a circle. again i  click smart dimension => click on perimeter => enter dimension. its fully defined as well (center anchored to origin)
* we will sketch and dimension an elipse 25mm height and 70mm wide on top plane
* change doc to mm
* draw the elipse
* unlike the circle smart dimensiong => click on param does not trigger dimensioning
* the  way to add dimensions on an ellipse is to click on each diameter (small and large) end points which trigger dimension for each
* ellipse is not fully defined with these 2 dimensions. it needs a 3rd (the distance ox x or y axis between an endpoint of large axis and small axis or center). the condition is to not be on same horizontal or vertical
* this is because i can rotate the elipse althoug anchored and axis defined
* if i try to add more than necessary dimensions. i get a warning. the sketch will be overdesigned. if i keep not necessary dimensions.. they are grey in color

### Lecture 18 - Yes, we can use Angles too!

* in previous lecture we used dimensions to define our sketch
* we want to define a triangle of 100mm base with left angle 60o and right andle 80o
* i draw a triangle with 3 lines. i dont care about size or angles
* click smart dimensioning and set base line to 100mm
* to dimension angle i click on both side lines then i see the angle dimension
* i define both sides angles and my triangle is fully defined (origin is anc)

### Lecture 19 - Using Relations to Define your Sketch Part 1 - Between Lines and Points

* Relations we will go through:
	* Horizontal
	* Vertical
	* Merge
	* Midpoint
	* Coincident
	* Parallel
	* Perpendicular
	* Equal
* Relations are ways to define parts of the sketch by linking them to each other or the sketch plane
* **Horizontal & Vertical Relation**
* in sketch mode we add to random lines (not related)
* the hor or ver relationship is regarding to the plane axis
* if i click on a line in properties (left menu) i see 3 relationships (ver hor fix)
* clicking on one is added on existing relations and is applied (added as green icon)
* if i move the line it moves holding the applied relationship
* if i click on one point + CTRL + Click on the other line point i get more relations options (point-to-point) regarding the relationship of one to the other. I chose vertical (both points on same vertical line)
* so my 2 lines are bound to each other by this point2point relationship
* **Merge,Midpoint,Concident**
* clicking on 2 points (on different lines) and chosing merge relationship merges both points to 1
* I click on a lines point + CTRL + click on line. i get point to line relationships (midpoint or coincident)
	* midpoint places the point to the middle of the line. moving the poiint or line maintains the relationship
	* coincident places the line to a place so that if it expands on its direction it will meet the point
* **Parallel,Perpendicular**
* we add 2 lines . click on both (using CTRL) to see the line-to-line relationships. 
* i select parallel. if i move one the other maintains the relationship
* if i choose perpendicular both are vertical one to the other
* if i choose equal the will have equal size to each other
* to fix regarding origin. i click a line and orign and click concident 

### Lec 20 - Using Relations to Define Your Sketches Part 2 -Between Circles, Ellipses, Lines

* we will implement a sketch composed by 4 circles 2 elipses and 3 lines.
* we will apply relations: horizontal, vertical, tangent, cocentric, equal and coincident
* we start at front plane
* we draw the elements without caring on relations or dimensions
* we start setting the relations between circles
* click 1st cricle CTRL click 2nd curcle => apply Cocentric. both now share the same center. we do the same for other group
* outer circles are equal. so i click on both (CTRL) and set equal. same for inner circles in both groups
* outer circles must be tangent to each other (touch)
* centers are horizontal (click on both and add horizontal)
* distance between circles is .5 inches. we add smart dimension (click on one circle perimeter then click on the other)
* right outer circle is tangent to right line (click line and circle and apply Tangent rel) do the same for left
* we want end of line on both sides to be coincident with circle perim. click end of line and circle perimeter apply Coincident. do it both sides
* elipses are cocentric. we apply the rel
* outer elipse is tangent to both circles. y apply tangent between elipse and each of the 2 circles (2 relations)
* elipses large axis are horizontal. we select all points of minor azis and make them horizontal
* major axis points on both elipses are coincident
* other point is midpoint on horizontal line. we apply the rel
* we apply smart dimension between two elipses minor axis points (.5in)
* i fiz bottom left corner to origin
* left line is 5in (add smart dim). bottom same (equal rel)
* we see in sample that center point of circles is in same vertical with outer elipse midpoints
my design is fully defined

### Lecture 21 - SOLIDWORKS Applying Relations Automatically!! How does that work!?

* solidworks adds relations automatically while we sketch
	* horizontal
	* vertical
	* coincident
	* midpoint
	* tangent 
	* cocentric
* we scetch or right plane
* if i start a line from origin i get concentric relation 
* yellow rel color is a rel currently applied (temp) once i finish the element it becomes permanent 
* if i move a line horizontaly or veritcaly i get these relatios to the plane for free
* if i drag a new line point on an existing line i get coiccident rel available. when i pass from middle point of existing line i get midpoint
* if i draw an area element (circle) and touch the line i get tangent rel 
* if i start a new circle with same center i get cocentric relationship

### Lecture 22 - Knowing and Deleting Active 

* if we get a sketch with a lot of relationships we want to kow about them.
* in sketch mode if i click on an element in the proiperties i see the applied relationships. if i click on one i see the element or point it is applied with highlighter. in the list i can delete relationships
* if i highlight all sketchj in the properties i see all applied rels
* if i hover on a rel icon i see the involved entities

### Lecture 23 - Additional Lines: Construction Lines and Center Lines

* a centreline is available in command menu as an alt line
* construction geometry is used to assist in creating the sketch entities and geometries. they are ignored when the sketch is used to create a feature. Some call them construction lines while others  call them centerlines
* say we want to draw 4 circles centered on 4 tips of a square. we dont want the square to be visible or contstructed
* we draw a square centered around the origin and apply equal rel
* then i draw 4 circles around each edge. i apply equal rel to all of them
* we are ready relation whise. we dont want to show the rect as constre element
* if we delete them we will lose the relationship
* i select all 4 lines and in properties bottom click 'for constrution'. rect is now dashed

### Lecture 24 - More Sketch Commands: Mirror, Offset, Patterns and Trim
